  <li>Elementary and Middle school </li>
  <u> I attended Temple Hill Academy for kindergarden through eigth grade.
   I graduated in 2014 with honors and took two high school courses during eigth grade,
   which were Earth Science and Integrated Algebra. I was also in the National
   Junior Honor Society when graduating.<u>

  <li>High School</li>
  I am currently attending Newburgh Free Academy and in the Excelsior program.
  The Excelsior program is a program that allows fifty students every year to
  recieve an Applied Associates degree in either Cybersecurity or Newtworking
  when graduating high school.The program ranges from four to six years, depending
  on the students course.
  <li>College</li>
  I am currently taking classes at SUNY Orange in Newburgh, New York, thanks to
   the Excelsior Academy. At this moment I am taking College Algebra 101 and
   College and Career Readiness. I am also taking AP Physics so when I pass
   the regents it will count as a college class.
